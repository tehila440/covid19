# covid19
Kaggle posted up to date info on Covid 19.  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)
I used this data and population information from [CIA World FactBook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/) to explore COVID cases by state and 
country in real time.  Most of this was just for my own curiosity and not focused on a competition.
